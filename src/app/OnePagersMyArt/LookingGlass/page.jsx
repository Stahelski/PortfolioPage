// A page where you are looking through a window. There are some raindrops on the window and the sun is shining through.
// The background is blurry because of the drops, and it's a lush green scene with a modern house with big glass windows.
// You interact with the window as if a finger is touching the glass and interacting with the drops.

// Explaining how a window looks from the inside:
// You see through the window, but you also see some sort of slightly white reflection depending on the interior—usually angular.

// Explaining how the drops look on the window:
// The background is blurry because of the drops.
// The individual drops show the color of the background shining through, upside down (usually darker on the top, lighter and clearer on the bottom).

// Explaining how the interaction looks:
// The mouse is a transparent circle with a whitish border.
// When you drag the mouse over the screen, it leaves a trail of smaller drops,
// and collects the bigger drops until there is too much water surrounding the circle,
// causing drops to roll down the window—interacting with each drop on their way down and leaving a clear transparent line behind.

// Pseudocode
// Create a window/plane of glass – Use a 3D canvas.
